## Reflection

This project served as a personal learning experience with the .NET Framework, particularly with WPF and XAML. Initially conceived as "RZ1 (RhamZtation)" to function as a glorified Steam application for managing personal game projects, it evolved into a more comprehensive digital portfolio application, aptly renamed "myPortfolio."

The development process involved significant trial and error, particularly in selecting the appropriate framework. After experimenting with C++ and Qt, as well as Java and JavaFX, I ultimately decided to use C# and WPF. Though I was familiar with Java, learning C# was relatively straightforward. XAML, with its similarities to HTML, also proved manageable.

One of the most significant challenges was adapting to the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern, which was new to me. While I had prior experience with the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, understanding the distinction between ViewModel and Controller required some adjustment. Nevertheless, I gained a solid understanding of MVVM through this project.

The application was developed using Visual Studio, with XAML as the markup language and C# as the programming language. Various NuGet packages were utilized for tasks such as image/icon management and PostgreSQL database connectivity. Although there were plans to migrate the database from PostgreSQL to SQL Server and complete additional features, the project has been archived before these changes could be implemented.

Thank you for taking the time to explore myPortfolio. While active development has ceased, the lessons learned during its creation will inform future projects.
